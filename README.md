## Syntax Debugging Practice

### Instructions

- Start by properly indenting the file. Use the curly brackets as your guide.
- Open the index.html file in Chrome, and then open the console. You will see errors. Go in to the app.js file, fix the error and refresh. Then you should see a new error.
- When all of the errors are fixed, the console should display '11 out of 11 correct'
