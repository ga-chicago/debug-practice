## Syntax Debugging Practice

I have added some common syntax errors to the app.js file. Your goal is to fix all of these errors, and have the file run successfully.

### Instructions

1. Open this project in Sublime.
2. Start by properly indenting the app.js file. Use the curly brackets as your guide.
3. Open the index.html file in Chrome, and then open the console. You will see errors. Go in to the app.js file, fix the error and refresh. Then you should see a new error.
4. When all of the errors are fixed, the console should display '11 out of 11 correct'
